Recent weeks I was working on my portfolio website. Previously when I build it, I was satisfied as it was my first successfully deployed project. 

## Then, I realized that I have made lot of blunders!

## Those blunders were:
- Combined the two sections into one in the navigation bar
- The biggest one, had a % skills bar

All thanks to the webdev Community, I got to know these mistakes and rectify them.

## So, how did I fixed my mistakes ?

- Applied CSS separately to each section, which helped me crossing out my first error.
- Added logos instead of % bars.

I think this version is a lot better than the previous one !

I know there's a lot to work on, and <strong>I am on it</strong> !
