Last week I tried the Foobar challenge.

It is a set of coding challenges of five levels. Difficulty increases as we proceed each level. We can code the solutions in Python or Java. My weapon was Python.

I have completed 3 levels of the challenges (Further challenges are totally out of my reach!). Here are the lessons I learnt after attempting the challenge.

## 1. Make your concepts “crystal-clear”

The first challenge went quite easy. But during the second one I had to brush-up some points to be able to solve it. And that consumed my most of the time.

## 2. Solve the problem first

Solving the question prior to coding gives us an idea of what and how to code. Starting to code in vague, leads to more confusion.

## 3. Test your code

Testing the code lets us know how we can improve our code for the correct solution.

## 4. Take your time

All work and no play makes Jack dull. Thinking about a problem for long time doesn’t help much. Take a break. Fresh up your mind and then get back to code !
