Sometimes we become less productive. And lose sight of the big picture and wonder why are we even doing this.

Sometimes we might become too stressed or maybe we could have mixed up our priorities. And then we go on browsing different things to get our mood back.

Everytime I tried different things that gets me back on track. And one of the thing I do is recollect and ask myself why I started? Sometimes I couldn't even do that, I'm too lazy,lol... But, I decided to write up to  stay focused.

Let's begin!

# Problem Solving Ability

Problem-solving isn’t just about addressing negative situations – it’s about exploiting opportunities. Problem-solving skills help people understand their environment.

# Power to create

The more we create, the more we discover and realize our habits, impulses, and desires. When we take the time and energy to develop our own ideas, we respect our inner nature and are better able to express ourselves to the world on a regular basis.

We all know how Tony Stark built himself an Ironman Suit and became a superhero.

# The Experience!

When we share a common experience, it boosts our sense of belonging, and this in turn makes us feel life is more worthwhile. Also, when we share a positive experience, we enjoy it more than we would if we experience it on our own - even when we share it with people we've never met. Together people learn and make sense out of those experiences. At the end, it's about the journey !
