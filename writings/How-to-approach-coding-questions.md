Hi everyone !

Today I will be sharing some hints to solve coding questions efficiently.

Let's begin !

## Step 1 : Understand the question.
This will help to know how the solution should look like. If a question is complex, divide it into parts.

## Step 2 : Brainstorm the solution.
I would suggest to think on paper rather in mind. Solve a single part at once. Don't jump to conclusions.

## Step 3 : Read the errors.
The compiler talks to us with the help of those errors. Learn to read the errors and rectify them accordingly.

## Step 4 : Introspect your code.
Observe your code. Know your mistakes & try not to repeat them. Also, remember the tips which helped you to get closer to solution.

So, that's it !
These were some of my tips of how to approach any coding problem efficiently.
